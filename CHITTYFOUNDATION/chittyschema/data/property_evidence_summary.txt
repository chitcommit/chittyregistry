LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE
------------------
Under Illinois law (750 ILCS 5/503), property acquired before marriage
remains separate property unless transmuted to marital property through:
- Joint titling
- Commingling of funds
- Written agreement
- Substantial marital contributions

Burden of proof rests on party asserting marital character of pre-marital property.

CRITICAL EVIDENCE ITEMS

- Deeds showing sole ownership
- ALTA policies confirming unmarried status
- Bank records showing pre-marital funding sources
- LLC formation documents pre-dating marriage
- Mortgage documents in individual name only
